Computer Engineer with extensive experience in network and **systems administration**, **project management** and **cybersecurity**. My knowledge in **data science** (machine learning, deep learning) complements my profile, allowing me to address technological challenges from a comprehensive perspective. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong ability to identify and **solve complex problems**, as well as to transmit technical knowledge in a clear and effective way. My approach is based on adaptability, continuous improvement and the search for innovative solutions.

In my free time I love to continue training and practice my sports (athletics and triathlon).

I run half marathon races because that's how I see life: as a long-distance race in which it is as important to go fast as it is to properly distribute your resources.
